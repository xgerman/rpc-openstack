# Bug: https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/199
# Issue: To avoid any dependency issues that have occured in the past, the
#        repo_server containers are re-built. This was done as part of the
#        OSA upgrade script in liberty, but is not done in the OSA mitaka
#        upgrade script. Thus, we destroy the containers here.

# TASK #5
# Bug: https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack/issues/2266
# Issue: In Liberty the console was Spice, which was moved to novnc
#        for the Mitaka release. On upgrade this results in both novnc
#        and Spice to run, but spice does not get updated as it is removed
#        from the nova_console_type in
#        /etc/openstack_deploy/user_osa_variables_defaults.yml file.
#        A post-upgrade check for nova services will fail if a nova service
#        from a previous release is running.
#        The cleanest fix to this is to destroy and rebuild all console
#        containers which will only rebuild the novnc console

# TASK #6
# Bug:   https://github.com/rcbops/u-suk-dev/issues/383
# Issue: The ceph-all.yml playbook will fail because of the hostname
#        changes introduced in Mitaka. This section recreates the mons
#        in a rolling fashion so quorum is maintained, and hostnames
#        are properly referenced in the ceph datasets(i.e monmap)
# NOTE:  Before running test-upgrade.sh on an AIO with ceph, variables
#        in the overrides file will need to be generated manually by
#        running migrate-yaml.py(similiar to TASK #0). The deployer
#        must ensure that osd_directory and raw_mutli_journal are not
#        both set to True in user_rpco_variables_overrides.yml. If this
#        isn't done, this TASK will fail.
#        In gating this is handled by gate-specific overrides set in
#        the jenkins-rpc repository.

# These are the instructions to give if there is a failure message on ceph-mon.yml
